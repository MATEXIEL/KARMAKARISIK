## Prompts

- **I want to create a game using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS, where the player will try to correctly type the given word, but there will be rules which will effect the input of the player. For example, if a rule like "a <--> b" is set, if the player wants to type "a", they should hit "b" on their keyboard and vice versa. Can you create a roadmap for this project, and illuminate me on points that need special attention? Thanks.**

- **Can you name me some websites for free audios to be used in my project?**

- **I need help figuring out how to publish a Github Page.**
